### Edit CFP Settings

Settings are provided by `application.properties` file or by JVM arguments.

Development settings are in `config/application.properties` of this repo.
Global, embedded, settings are defined in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

Please read [Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html) for more information:

You also need to edit `src/main/static/app/scripts/app.js` to add your providers tokens:

```javascript
  .constant('Config', {
    'recaptcha': 'yourRecaptchaPublicToken',
    'googleClientId': 'yourGoogleClientId',
    'githubClientId': 'yourGithubClientId'
  })
```

## Deployment

* NodeJS is required to run frontend build tools. The build has been tested with version 4.2.2. Its installation is
included in the Maven build. However, if you want to contribute to frontend, you may install it by yourself to be able
to use frontend build tools from the command line.

### Development

You need a MySQL database to start the application. If you have Docker, you can launch one for development with

```bash
$ mysql-dev.sh
```

#### Backend development

If you intend to contribute to backend exclusively and don't want to deal with the NodeJS tools necessary for frontend
development and build, you can start the application with the following command:

```bash
$ mvn -Prelease spring-boot:run
```

You can start `fr.sii.Application#main()` on your favorite IDE too.

#### Frontend development

Frontend contributors can use usual frontend build tools from the command line:

* Gulp and Bower are required to build. You can install them with:
    ```bash
    $ npm install -g gulp bower
    ```

* To install build tools dependencies specified in `package.json`, you have to run the following in project root folder:
    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

* To install project third party libraries specified in `bower.json`, you have to run the following in project root folder:
    ```bash
    $ bower install
    ```

A Gulp task `gulp serve` is available to facilitate contributions to the front code. It starts a
web server on port 3000 for files in `src/main/static/app` directory. Livereload is configured and
requests to the backend are forwarded to the AppEngine development server (`http://127.0.0.1:8080`) thanks to an proxy.

    ```bash
    $ gulp serve # or gulp serve:dist for minified version of front files, but no livereload in this case
    ```

### Contribution and project infrastructure

Development take places on branch `master`. We have a CI job setup to validate pull-requests, please avoid direct push to master.
Contributors, please sign-off your commits (`git commit --signoff`)
Production environment is configured to deploy from `production` branch. Another CI job do build and deploy from this branch automatically.
So please test from `master` branch before pushing to `production`.
